# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This web application is a simple hourly schedule to keep track of your meetings and events throughout the day. Each hour during the traditional work day is listed with a text box. The user can enter events in the text box; upon clicking save, the events are saved to local storage. Events will persist after refreshing the page. Hourly blocks are color coded based on the time of day: the current hour is colored red, future hours are colored green, and hours in the past are grey.

The preview below shows the planner after 5 pm, when all blocks are colored grey.

## Motivation
The scheduler was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JQuery and BootStrap were used to enhance JavaScript functionality and CSS styling.

After learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I wanted to practice to become more familiar. I also wanted to become more familiar with JQuery, since it is a commonly used JavaScript library. In addition to JQuery, I also used Bootstrap elements to style the page. 

## How to Access

The daily scheduler application is deployed on GitHub Pages. The application is accessed in the browser window.
